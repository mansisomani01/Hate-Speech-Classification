# Decoding Hate: KNN, LSTM and BERT in the Pursuit of Safer Online Spaces in Hindi

# Data Description
For our study on abusive text detection in Hindi, we
leveraged a dataset containing a collection of comments in
the Hindi language. The dataset comprises approximately 20,000 comments,
providing a substantial corpus for training and evaluating our
models. The comments were sourced from various online
platforms, ensuring a diverse representation of language usage
and contexts. The dataset can be downloaded from given [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LTmoA7EFX3LoQI3eyCrrMJr9DMEMqupO).

# Label Distribution
- 0 - Abusive
- 1 - Non-Abusive

# Models
- KNN + TF-IDF
- LSTM
- BERT
